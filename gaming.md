# Gaming/Tech

#### Gaming
While I love sports, I am also a pretty big nerd when it comes to gaming and tech. I go through phases where I play either no video games at all for a few months, or I'm playing a lot. 
Recently the two games I have been playing are the new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and Valve's new game Deadlock. Black Ops 6 is surprisingly good as the first Call of Duty game I've played in 5 or 6 years. Personally I'm more of a Zombies guy than Multiplayer. ![BO6](BO6.jpg)



#### Tech
I really enjoy building computers, I have only built one for myself, but I have built several for friends. [**Here**](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/GWykV7) is the list of specs for the PC I built for myself a few years ago. Its crazy how the prices have dropped and how much the tech has advanced.
