## Sports
#### Football
I am a **massive** football fan **especially** when it comes to Mizzou. One of the greatest memories I have is the [_Border War_ game against Arkansas in 2014](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/400548325/arkansas-missouri). My Dad took me to that game, we won the game and won the SEC East as well, I got to see the students rush the field, and at 11 years old I knew I wanted to be a Tiger. I also played football a bit growing up.![Alt text](https://zounation.com/frank-broyles-and-the-art-of-defection/"fieldrush")

#### Basketball 
Basketball is my second favorite sport, I'm not a huge _NBA_ fan but I **Love** college basketball, specifically _March Madness_.
I played basketball for several years when I was younger, I need to start playing again.

#### Baseball
I played baseball for 12 years, I used to love it but I burnt myself out sadly. I also _HATE_ the current state of the _MLB_, the lack of salary caps and differing of contracts ****don't belong** in professional sports in my opinion, the _MLB_ is on track to have 4-5 teams with a monopoly on All-Star Players
